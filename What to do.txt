Spring Security
->role-based access control(different permissions for different users).
->integrating OAuth2 for secure login via external providers(Google,Facebook,etc).
->secure communication between microservices - maybe HTTPS, and maybe JWT(JSON Web Tokens).

Spring Cloud
->microservices architecture
	-creating separate services for user management,task management, notifications, etc.
->Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway - route requests to various microservices
->utilize Spring Cloud Config Server(all configurations in a centralized location).
->spring cloud SLEUTH and ZIPKIN for distributed tracing(debugging+monitor tracing requests across microservices)
->Circuit breaker pattern(like Hystrix)
